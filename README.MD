# Towards Situtational Awareness of Espionage Satellites
### Research Objective
Utilize state of the art deep-learning techniques to detect a satelliteâ€™s model and its relative orientation using images captured of the satellite. 

## Deep Learning 
We optimize the hyperparameters of four CNNs from the ImageNet challenge in a fine-tunning setting. 

## Synthetic Dataset
We utilize Unity Engine and NASA's 3D Model Library to generate images of satellites from various perspectives.

## Simulating Atmospheric Blur
We utilize kolomogorv filters to distort images in our synthetic dataset to mimic images of espionage satellites taken by earth-based astrophotographers.

## Cloud Computing
We utilizes Amazon Web Services to train our models in parallel.
